**Deliverables:**
1. Technical report
2. An A2 poster for the presentation
3. A dashboard

**Business questions:**
- 1 predictive analytics question (will be discussed in the insight creation capability using an ML canvas)
- 1 descriptive analytics question (will be answered by a dashboard)
- Another analytics question that could be answered by EITHER an ML canvas or a dashboard

Note that the dashboard should try to include all the information that leads to the answer of the prediction.

*Example:*
- Can we predict customers who are likely to cancel their subscriptions? (answered by the attached ML canvas)
- What are the significant churn factors? (answered by a dashboard)

**The report should follow this outline**
1. Introduction (your business questions and your dataset)
2. Organizational memory
3. Information integration
4. Insight creation (includes the ML canvas)
5. Presentation
6. Summary
7. Reference [optional]
